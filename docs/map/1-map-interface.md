## Main Components

- Drag the cursor to move the playback position of the audio.
- **Timeline Features**
  - **Add BPM Markers** allow you to dynamically change bpm in the middle of a song.

  - Adjusting **Playback Speed** will adjust the speed of the music in the Composer, this playback speed **does not change in-game**.
  - **"Snap to"** setting defines how the notes will snap to the beats. Select None if you want to smoothly move them around without snapping.
  - You can zoom in and out by using the zoom slider or [shortcuts](/docs/controls).
  - Move the timeline window by dragging the scroll bar at the bottom.

### Toolbar
- In the toolbar, there are useful tools to place notes, as well as utility tools like copy and paste.
- The note placement tools are only available when the cursor is in a __valid__ timestamp (non-red area) to place down a note.
### Viewport
- Viewport gives you the ability to see how your level will look before you share it with others.
- You can also directly place and edit notes in the viewport.
- Additionally, you can click on the notes in viewport to edit them.
- When your mouse is hovering in the viewport, scrolling will move the playback position of the audio.
### Properties Panel
- In the properties panel, you can adjust note settings.
- When multi-editing, all the properties will show up. Editing a type-specific property will only apply changes to the notes of that type in your selection.
