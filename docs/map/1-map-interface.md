## Main Components
### Timeline
- Timeline is where you can place and arrange map notes.
- Drag the cursor to move the playback position of the audio.
- **Timeline Features**
  - **Add BPM Markers** allow you to dynamically change bpm in the middle of a song.

  - Adjusting **Playback Speed** will adjust the speed of the music in the Composer, this playback speed **does not change in-game**.
  - **"Snap to"** setting defines how the notes will snap to the beats. Select None if you want to smoothly move them around without snapping.
  - You can zoom in and out, or move the window using the zoom slider and the scroll bars, or [shortcuts](/docs/controls).

### Toolbar
- In the toolbar, there are useful tools to place notes, as well as utility tools like copy and paste.
- The note placement tools are only available when the cursor is in a __valid__ timestamp to place down a note.
### Preview Space
- Preview Space gives you the ability to see how your level will look before you share it with others.
- You can also directly place and edit notes in the preview space. To edit an existing note, click on the note in the preview space.
- When your mouse is hovering in the preview space, scrolling will move the playback position of the audio
### Properties Panel
- In the properties panel, you can adjust note settings.
- When multi-editing, all the properties will show up. Editing a type-specific property will only change all the notes of that type in your selection.
