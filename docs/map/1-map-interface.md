# Map Interface

## Main Components
### Timeline
- Timeline is where you can place and arrange map notes.
- Drag the cursor to move the playback position of the audio.
- Bpm Markers allow you to dynamically change bpm in the middle of a song.

- Snap setting defines how the notes will snap to the beats. Select None if you want to smoothly move them around without snapping.
- You can zoom in and out, or move the window using the zoom slider and the scroll bars, or shortcuts.

### Toolbar
- In the tool bar, there are useful tools to place down map notes and utility tools like copy and paste.
- The note placement tools are only available when the cursor is in a __valid__ timestamp to place down a note.
### Preview Space
- Preview Space gives you the ability to see how your level will look before you share it with others.
- You can directly edit map notes in the preview space. This is more intuitive and recommended.
- Scroll in the preview space to move the cursor between beats.
### Properties Panel
- In the properties panel, you can adjust note or clip settings.
- When multi-editing, all the properties will show up. Editing a type-specific property will only change all the notes of that type in your selection.
