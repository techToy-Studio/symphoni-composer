## Bubble Preview Time Window

The Bubble Preview Time Window refers to the amount of time the arc stays in view within the preview space. This time window is determined by the **Preview Time** dictated in the Setup tab. The longer the **Preview Time**, the slower the note.. and the shorter the **Preview Time**, the faster the note flies towards the ring.

The time window the player gets to swing at the arc is also dictated by **Preview Time**, so the shorter the **Preview Time** is, the harder it gets for the player to score.
