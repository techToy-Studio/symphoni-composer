# Bubble

<!-- ## Bubble Preview Time Window

The Bubble Preview Time Window refers to the amount of time the bubble preview shows up before becoming _active_ to detect player input. The Bubble Preview Time Window is equivalent to 50% of the **Note Preview Time** dictated in the Setup tab. The longer the **Note Preview Time**, the slower the preview visual indicator closes in.. and the shorter the **Note Preview Time**, the faster the preview visual indicator becomes.

**Note:** when in an _active_ state, the bubble registers player input -->

## What are Bubbles in Symphoni?
Bubbles are notes that challenge the player to precisely point at an orb over a period of time.
