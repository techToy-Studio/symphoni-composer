# Editing Notes

## Introduction to Notes in Symphoni
Notes are interactable cues that players must respond to in time with the music. 
Notes require specific actions from the player, such as swinging, pointing, or gliding, to match the rhythm and beat of the song.

Symphoni has three types of notes, each with unique mechanics and properties.
