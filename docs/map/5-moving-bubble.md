# Moving Bubble

<!-- ## Moving Bubble Preview Time Window

The Moving Bubble Preview Time Window refers to the amount of time the bubble preview shows up before becoming _active_ to detect player input. The Moving Bubble Preview Time Window behaves the same way as the [Bubble Preview Time]&#40;/docs/map/bubble#Bubble-Preview-Time-Window&#41;.

**Note:** when in an _active_ state, the bubble registers player input -->

## What are Moving Bubbles in Symphoni?
Moving Bubbles are notes that challenge the player to precisely point at a moving orb over a period of time.

## When Creating a New Moving Bubble
- Moving bubbles can be snapped to fixed positions by toggling "Snap" in _Create Tool Property_

## When Editing an Existing Moving Bubble
- You can select an existing moving bubble by:

  - Hover & click on a moving bubble in the viewport to select it
  - Click on the moving bubble in the timeline window
- Upon selecting a moving bubble, **you can make edits to it in the _Note Property Window_**

  - Timestamp here represents the start time of the moving bubble (when it becomes active)
  - Timestamp can be modified either by seconds or beat time
- Once selected, **you can also do the following in viewport**:

  - Modify the position by dragging the bubble
  - Drag and drop each white dot in the viewport to manipulate the path it follows
    - **Note**: the line drawn between the white dots does NOT correspond to how the bubble moves in-game
