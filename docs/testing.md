# Sideloading Your Symphoni
Before publishing your Symphoni on mod.io, you may want to test out your map locally in your headset.
This page provides a guide on how to sideload your custom song into the game.

## How to Sideload Custom Symphoni
1. Make sure Symphoni is installed in your Quest!
2. Install and setup [SideQuest Desktop App](https://sidequestvr.com/) on your PC
3. Connect your headset to SideQuest
4. Click the _**Manage Files**_ button (the folder icon) on the top right of the SideQuest interface
5. Navigate to `Android / Data / com.Techtoy.Symphoni / files`
6. If you don't see a "Custom" folder, create a new folder and name it "custom"
7. Upload your custom levels in this folder
8. Launch the game if you haven't already, click the _**Refresh**_ button in the _Symphoni Composer (Beta)_ browser
9. Your levels will be loaded and ready to play!
