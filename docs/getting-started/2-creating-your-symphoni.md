# Creating Your Symphoni

## Create

1. **Click "Create New"**

2. **Set Audio Track**
   - Choose the audio track for your Symphoni.

3. **Cover Image**
   - Add a cover image to represent your Symphoni in the game.
   - *Format*: PNG (Recommended: Perfect-square dimensions, e.g., 512x512 pixels)

4. **Song Details**
   - Provide the following details, which will be displayed in-game:
     - Song Name
     - Artist Name
     - Map Author Name (Your name or username)

5. **BPM (Beats Per Minute)**
   - Define the BPM of your audio clip. A higher BPM means more beats for note placement, while a lower BPM means fewer beats.

6. **Menu Preview Time**
   - Set the menu preview start and end time to define the portion of your audio clip that will play on the Symphoni song page.
   - *Example*: A start time of 4 seconds and an end time of 8 seconds will preview the 4-8 second range of your song.

7. **Music Start Offset Time**
   - The time in the song where the first beat starts (in seconds).
   - *Example*: 2.5 will mean your first beat will start at 2.5 seconds into the song.

8. **Difficulty Levels**
   - Add and configure difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard, Expert).
   - Recommended preview timing value for each level:
     - Easy: ~3 seconds (slower notes)
     - Medium: ~2 seconds Hard: ~1.5 seconds (faster notes)
     - Expert: ~1 second (super fast notes)
   - *Preview duration*: 0.1x of the preview time for bubbles.
