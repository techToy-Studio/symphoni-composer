# Map Design Guide

Welcome to the Symphoni Map Design Guide! This comprehensive resource will help you create engaging and enjoyable levels for Symphoni. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced creator, this guide will provide valuable insights into creating memorable musical experiences.

## Understanding the Basics

Before diving into level creation, it's important to understand the core elements that make a great Symphoni level:

- **Musical Flow**: How the gestures and patterns align with the music
- **Difficulty Progression**: How the challenge increases throughout the level
- **Visual Design**: How the environment enhances the gameplay experience
- **Player Engagement**: How to keep players interested and motivated

## Key Principles

### 1. Musicality First
- Design patterns that feel natural with the music
- Use the rhythm and melody to guide your gesture placement
- Consider the emotional impact of different musical sections

### 2. Progressive Difficulty
- Start with simple patterns to establish the rhythm
- Gradually introduce more complex gestures
- Provide moments of rest between challenging sections

### 3. Visual Harmony
- Create environments that complement the music
- Use visual cues to guide players through patterns
- Maintain a consistent theme throughout the level

### 4. Player Experience
- Test your levels from a player's perspective
- Gather feedback from the community
- Iterate and refine based on player responses
