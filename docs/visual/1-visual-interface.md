## Main Components
The visual interface is similar to the [map interface](/docs/map/map-interface), with some small tweaks.

### Resizable Timeline
Visual track list can get long, so we made the visual timeline is vertically resizable. Simply drag the top of the timeline to resize it.

### Camera View
In visuals you would want to view the environment at different angles. The Set View tool allows you to control the camera's angle.
The _Show Gizmos_ button also gives you some helpful indicators to align elements.
