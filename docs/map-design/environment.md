The environment is a crucial aspect of Symphoni levels, creating the visual atmosphere and enhancing the gameplay experience. This guide will help you design engaging and immersive environments.

## Understanding Environment Design

### Key Elements
- **Background**: The base visual space
- **Foreground**: Interactive elements
- **Lighting**: Mood and atmosphere
- **Effects**: Visual enhancements
- **Particles**: Dynamic elements

### Environment Types

#### 1. Natural Environments
- Forest settings
- Mountain landscapes
- Ocean scenes
- Sky environments

#### 2. Magical Environments
- Wizard towers
- Enchanted forests
- Crystal caves
- Floating islands

#### 3. Urban Environments
- Cityscapes
- Ancient ruins
- Modern structures
- Industrial areas

## Creating Effective Environments

### 1. Visual Design
- Choose appropriate theme
- Create visual hierarchy
- Use consistent style
- Consider color palette

### 2. Atmosphere
- Set the right mood
- Use lighting effectively
- Add ambient effects
- Create depth

### 3. Interactivity
- Add interactive elements
- Create visual feedback
- Design for player movement
- Consider accessibility

## Environment Design Process

### 1. Planning
- Choose theme
- Sketch layout
- Plan lighting
- Consider effects

### 2. Implementation
- Build basic structure
