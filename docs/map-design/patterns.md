# Creating Patterns

Patterns are the building blocks of engaging Symphoni levels. This guide will help you understand how to create effective patterns that enhance the musical experience.

## Understanding Patterns

### What is a Pattern?
A pattern is a sequence of gestures that work together to create a cohesive musical experience. Patterns can be:
- Simple (2-4 gestures)
- Complex (5+ gestures)
- Repeating
- Progressive
- Variational

### Pattern Types

#### 1. Basic Patterns
- **Mirror Pattern**: Gestures mirrored across the play space
- **Alternating Pattern**: Gestures alternating between sides
- **Cascade Pattern**: Gestures flowing in a sequence
- **Pulse Pattern**: Gestures pulsing with the beat

#### 2. Advanced Patterns
- **Call and Response**: One gesture followed by a complementary gesture
- **Wave Pattern**: Gestures flowing like a wave
- **Spiral Pattern**: Gestures spiraling outward or inward
- **Diamond Pattern**: Gestures forming a diamond shape

#### 3. Special Patterns
- **Burst Pattern**: Multiple gestures radiating from a point
- **Chain Pattern**: Gestures linked in a chain
- **Cluster Pattern**: Groups of gestures in clusters
- **Spread Pattern**: Gestures spreading across the space

## Creating Effective Patterns

### 1. Musical Considerations
- Match pattern rhythm to the music
- Use patterns to emphasize musical phrases
- Create patterns that flow with the melody
- Consider the song's structure

### 2. Visual Design
- Make patterns visually appealing
- Use consistent spacing
- Create clear visual paths
- Consider the environment

### 3. Player Experience
- Ensure comfortable movements
- Provide clear visual cues
- Create natural flow
- Test for accessibility

## Pattern Design Process

### 1. Planning
- Listen to the music
- Identify key moments
- Sketch pattern ideas
- Consider difficulty

### 2. Implementation
- Start with basic gestures
- Build up complexity
- Test frequently
- Make adjustments

### 3. Refinement
- Polish timing
- Add visual effects
- Test with players
- Gather feedback

## Best Practices

### 1. Pattern Structure
- Start simple, build complexity
- Create clear beginnings and endings
- Use consistent spacing
- Maintain visual clarity

### 2. Musical Integration
- Align with strong beats
- Follow musical phrases
- Create musical patterns
- Use rests effectively

### 3. Player Engagement
- Vary pattern types
- Create memorable moments
- Build anticipation
- Provide satisfaction

## Common Pattern Mistakes

1. **Overcomplication**
   - Too many gestures
   - Unclear patterns
   - Confusing timing
   - Poor flow

2. **Poor Timing**
   - Misaligned with music
   - Awkward transitions
   - Rushed sequences
   - Inconsistent rhythm

3. **Visual Issues**
   - Cluttered display
   - Unclear paths
   - Poor visibility
   - Inconsistent effects

## Pattern Examples

### Simple Pattern
```
Beat 1: Swipe Right
Beat 2: Swipe Left
Beat 3: Tap Center
Beat 4: Hold Center
```

### Complex Pattern
```
Beat 1: Circle Clockwise
Beat 2: Swipe Up + Tap
Beat 3: Swipe Down + Tap
Beat 4: Burst Center
```
