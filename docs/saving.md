## Saving your Symphoni

During the first time you try to save your Symphoni, you will be prompted to save it somewhere on your computer. Upon saving it, your data will be stored into a zip. 

The zip file contains all data your Symphoni needs to be distributed, uploaded, or loaded back into the Composer for further editing.

## Loading an existing Symphoni

You may also choose to load an existing Symphoni. This could be a work-in-progress level you are working on, or a level you may have downloaded from someone else.

When you choose to save an existing Symphoni, all level data will be saved to the existing zip file you loaded into Composer.

## Best Practices
- Save frequently
- Please make frequent backups upon saving! Composer is _not_ stable yet, so there is a chance your data could get lost due to bugs! 
- To ensure that your save worked, navigate back to the home page and reload the existing project to make sure all of the data loads as intended. Then, exit the level _without_ saving to make sure the save file stays the same as how you left it.
- When switching Symphoni projects, it is safer to close the app completely and relaunching before loading in a new one.
